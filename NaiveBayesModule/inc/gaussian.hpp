/**
 * The normal probability density function calculates a distance in "exponential" space between the two points "x" and 
 * "m". This is scaled through the variance "s". Usually the function is used to define a distance between a fixed 
 * point at "m" (the mean), and a given diffusion rate "s" around it (the variance).
